FUNNY FACE

1. The person to the left of Ariel takes out a blank piece of paper and a pen.
2. The same person makes one stroke/line/mark/shape on the page, then passes it to the person on their left
3. The same process of making a mark and passing it on to the next person repeats, with the goal of creating a face
4. Once the piece of paper has made two full rounds of the class, the person is done
5. The class must now come up with a name for this face and it will be hung on the board
